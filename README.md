2 or 3 word catchy title: Emergent software developer

Personal headline: I am a software developer with a determination to help people. I intend to apply my skills and my career to producing tech that will enhance the human experience.

Professional pitch:
My name is Kassie Bradshaw, I’m a software developer specializing in Python. Currently I’m a domestic engineer but I prefer to think of myself as a helper, a maker and a thinker. I love learning and languages, and the idea of writing code as a form of communicating and creating. I’m the kind of person that jumps at the chance for new experiences and I’m eager to step up and take on challenges. It’s led me to a lot of different jobs, but that has allowed me the opportunity to build up a wide variety of skills. I’m looking forward to a career that will allow me to use my skills to create and contribute to projects that will bring joy to other people or enhance their life in a meaningful way.

What excites me the most about tech?
The world of tech offers seemingly endless possibilities and an abundance of information. Ideas and visions can be brought to life, people can be connected, encouraged, inspired, and opportunity for learning is nearly limitless.
